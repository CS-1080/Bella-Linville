        <p>Despite being uncommon, moss lawns can grow everywhere except arid, drought prone areas. While they are a large initial investment, it'll soon be paid off as moss lawns require little to no upkeep. These lawns are desne stands of moss, with a similar feeling to soft, grass lawns. Due to its nonvascular nature, moss never grows above roughly 4 inches. 
        They can grow in any kind of soil, no matter the quality. It does well in difficult conditions such as slopes, or hillsides. Moss lawns are also a great way to save water, as they need very little once established.</p>

Lastly, clover lawns are naturally fertilizing. Clover is a legume, which means that it naturally fixes nitrogen, the chemical found in fertilizer which stimulates growth!</p>
