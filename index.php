        <h2>The Danger of Traditional Lawns</h2>
        <p class="border">You see them everywhere sprawled throughout suburbs. Dads proudly mow them every week, their pride and joy. Lawns full of green grass may look tidy and neat, but what if I told you
            they weren't so green? While upkept lawns have become a staple of suburban America, they may be harming local ecosystems. Their upkeep comes with a high carbon cost, and burns holes in the pockets of homeowners. 
            Maintaining a lawn requires an unsustainable amount of water, a resource many of which don't even have readily available access to. 
            The fertilizers, pesticides, and weedkillers needed to upkeep a respectable lawn can have dire indirect effects on surrounding ecosystems such as eutrification, chemical contamination, and unintentional herbicide or pesticide. 
            Furthermore, traditional lawns diminish local biodiversity. Lawns effectively displace local fuana by destroying their habitats. Overall this decreases the stability of local ecosystems, as biodiversity is a key factorn to the resilience and wellbeing of environs.</p>

If you live somewhere that's prone to droughts, succulents may be a better option than flowers. This option is a bit more expensive than the previous alternative lawns, but if you have the resources for it makes for a beautiful ecofriendly lawn.</li>
